## Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

## IDEA: Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:
Percent difference of body fat lost by a group of dieters compared to a group of non-dieters for three months is equal or less than the percent difference of body fat lost by a group who exercise compared to a group of a group who do not exercise for three months, significance level p=0.05.

$H_0$ : S0[comparative % body fat lost of dieters] - S1[comparative % body fat lost of exercise group] <= 0

$H_a$ : S0 - S1 > 0

$\alpha$ = 0.05

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
Percent difference of body fat lost by a group of dieters compared to a group of non-dieters for three months is greater than the percent difference of body fat lost by a group who exercise compared to a group of a group who do not exercise for three months, significance level p=0.05.

## IDEA: Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:
The proportion of public opinion of adults polled who do not trust the president is greater than the proportion who idicated their expections are met, significance level p=0.05.

$H_0$ : P0[Proportion of public opinion of adults polled who do not trust the president] > 0.5

$H_a$ : P1[Proportion of public opinion of adults polled who trust the president] > 0.5

$\alpha$ = 0.05

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
Public opinion of adults polled, significance level p=0.05.

## IDEA: Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:
The cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch is less than or equal to the cessation rates for smokers given a placebo patch, significance level p=0.05.

$H_0$ : S0[cessation rate of nicotine patch users] - S1[cessation rate of placebo patch group] <= 0

$H_a$ : S0 - S1 > 0

$\alpha$ = 0.05

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
The cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch is greater than the cessation rates for smokers given a placebo patch, significance level p=0.05.

## IDEA: Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:
Children ages between the ages of 1 to 4 whose mother smoked during pregancy score equal or higher in IQ tests than children in the same age whose mother did not smoke during pregancy, significance level p=0.05.

$H_0$ : C0[IQ test score of childen whose mother smoked during pregancy] - C1[IQ test score of childen whose mother did not smoke during pregancy] >= 0

$H_a$ : C0 - C1 < 0

$\alpha$ = 0.05

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
Children ages between the ages of 1 to 4 whose mother smoked during pregancy score lower in IQ tests than children in the same age whose mother did not smoke during pregancy, significance level p=0.05.
